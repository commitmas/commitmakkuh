### Useful to Me?
* If you feel inexperienced with git, markdown and GitHub
* If you have 15 minutes to spare, every day, during the holidays

### Participate
1. Join the Commitmas Slack Team: https://commitmas-invite.herokuapp.com
1. Hop into the #commitmakkuh channel 
1. Say hello! Everyone else in that channel is learning the basics or willing to help
1. Commit ANYTHING to GitHub every single day 

If you're forgetful or just need a prompting sometimes, we'll have a bot egging you on! 

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember that the goal of this is to *learn how to use GitHub*, so focus on git, not other code you'd also like to learn
* Feel free to use the GitHub website, native apps or command line. [Watch past vBrownBag](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaZf13iWhwnBdpIkrEmHLbA/videos) on GitHub to help you along
* Markdown is awesomely powerful, so challenge yourself to use some of the more complex syntax. [You can learn it all here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
